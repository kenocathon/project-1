This is a website for Armor Installations. This is a construction company owned by my brother. They do general purpose construction work.

There are five pages. Home, Residential, Commercial, About Us, and Contact Us. All of the pages can be accessed by the top navigation. The Contact us page has a form that the user can use to contact the company.  There is also an image slider on the home page with some of the work that they have completed recently.

## Technolgies used.
- html
- css 
- javascript


## Ideas for future improvement
- Make the contact form more robust with more questions related to the work to be done by the company.
- Use more advanced css to make tie the page together better.
- Use a backend language for the contact form.
- Work with the client to develop more content that displays their company in a trustworthy way.
